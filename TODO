TODO: Need to pass other std::vector to update Tetromino, because the grid is with the playfield so, probably I can't erase the line because will erase de Playfield too. --Maybe not because I can check if the position of the mino is bigger than 11 * TILES and less than 24 * TILES(this is the x position of the grid walls).

TODO: Rotation of Z is broken is flip before rotating, so when rotate it look like mino S.

TODO: See if can use array instead of vector on tetrominos class : Row:27

TODO: Tetromino class has a lot of public fuction who could be private.

TODO: Put a Icon on the window, and to the .exe aswell.

TODO: Clean the code.

NOTE: Test rotation with 4 width, maybe with 3 width can't make t-spin/S-Spo etc

NOTE: See if can create a class named Tile to use.

TODO: Need to create a render class. --maybe. I made a simple class who can create a window, but fo now i don't think it will be useful
TODO: Make a menu for the game, UI Class. Note: Made a simple fuction to buttons
